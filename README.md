This project contains Simulink models and simulations focused on analyzing and improving vehicle dynamics through various subsystems. The models were developed to study ride quality, stability, and handling characteristics under different operating conditions.

Features
Suspension Dynamics (Quarter and Half Car Models):
Created detailed quarter-car and half-car suspension models to evaluate the dynamic response of vehicles under varying road profiles. These models aid in understanding ride comfort and suspension performance.

Lateral Vehicle Dynamics Simulation:
Simulated vehicle behavior in terms of yaw rate, lateral velocity, and turning radius using Simulink Multibody. This helps analyze how the vehicle responds to steering inputs and road curvature, contributing to improved handling performance.

Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) Logic Development:
Implemented ABS control algorithms in Simulink to enhance braking performance and maintain vehicle stability during emergency braking scenarios. The simulation validates effectiveness across multiple surface conditions.

Tools Used
MATLAB Simulink

Simulink Multibody (formerly Simscape Multibody)

Purpose
These simulations are intended for use in automotive engineering projects focusing on chassis and braking system development, and serve as a learning tool for understanding fundamental vehicle dynamics.
